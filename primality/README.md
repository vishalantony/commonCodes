This code tests for primality.<br>
For larger number, it shifts to probabilistic algorithm, i.e., Miller-Rabin algorithm<br>
to test the primality. Upto 10^20, it uses deterministic algorithm.<br>
To run:<br>
./primality_tester.py number [accuracy] <br>
<br>
Accuracy is optional and if not provided, it sets to 0.001
